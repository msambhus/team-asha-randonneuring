# Team Asha Randonneuring

A static website for **Team Asha Randonneuring** — a group of Bay Area cyclists who participate in ultra-distance randonneuring events while raising funds for the education of underprivileged children in India through [Team Asha](https://www.ashanet.org/).

## What This Site Does

- Tracks rider participation across multiple brevet seasons (2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2025-2026)
- Shows individual rider profiles with career stats, finish times, and Super Randonneur achievements
- Displays an upcoming ride calendar sourced from [RUSA](https://rusa.org/) for San Francisco, Davis, and Santa Cruz regions
- Links to RideWithGPS routes with elevation and ft/mile data
- Documents team resources (gear, lights, nutrition, ride reports)
- Celebrates PBP (Paris-Brest-Paris) finishers

## How It Works

The site is generated by `build_site.py`, a Python script that:

1. Reads rider and event data from an Excel spreadsheet (`Asha Randonneuring.xlsx`)
2. Enriches events with RUSA finish times from `rusa_results.csv`
3. Adds route details (RWGPS links, elevation, ft/mile) from `route_data.json`
4. Loads upcoming RUSA events from `rusa_events.json`
5. Generates static HTML pages in the `output/` directory

## Data Sources

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Asha Randonneuring.xlsx` | Master spreadsheet with rider data and event participation |
| `rusa_results.csv` | RUSA finish times scraped from rusa.org (pipe-delimited) |
| `rusa_events.json` | Upcoming RUSA events for Bay Area regions |
| `route_data.json` | RideWithGPS links, elevation, and ft/mile for SFR and SCR routes |

## Deployment

The site auto-deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) on push to `main`. The output directory (`output/`) contains the static HTML files served by Vercel.

## Building Locally

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
python build_site.py
```

Output is generated in the configured output directory.
