<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Randonneuring</strong> is long-distance unsupported endurance cycling. Organized globally by <strong>Audax Club Parisien (ACP)</strong> and in the US by <strong>Randonneurs USA (RUSA)</strong>, it tests a cyclist's ability to ride long distances within time limits, navigating through checkpoints called controls.
</div>

<h3>Brevets de Randonneurs Mondiaux (BRM)</h3>
<p>BRMs are the core events of randonneuring. They are organized at standard distances with strict time limits based on a minimum average speed of 15 km/h:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>200 km</strong> &mdash; Time limit: 13.5 hours</li>
<li><strong>300 km</strong> &mdash; Time limit: 20 hours</li>
<li><strong>400 km</strong> &mdash; Time limit: 27 hours</li>
<li><strong>600 km</strong> &mdash; Time limit: 40 hours</li>
<li><strong>1000 km</strong> &mdash; Time limit: 75 hours</li>
<li><strong>1200 km</strong> &mdash; Time limit: 90 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Riders must pass through designated control points (checkpoints) within specified opening and closing times. The controls ensure riders maintain adequate pace &mdash; not too slow, and importantly, not too fast either.</p>

<h3>Super Randonneur (SR)</h3>
<p>The prestigious <strong>Super Randonneur</strong> title is earned by completing a full series of BRMs &mdash; 200km, 300km, 400km, and 600km &mdash; all within a single ACP calendar year (November to October). This requires not just physical fitness but also consistent commitment across months of training and riding.</p>

<h3>Paris-Brest-Paris (PBP)</h3>
<p><strong>Paris-Brest-Paris</strong> is the oldest and most prestigious cycling event still in existence, dating back to 1891. This 1,200km ride from Paris to Brest and back must be completed within 90 hours. Held every four years, PBP is the ultimate goal for many randonneurs worldwide. To qualify, riders must complete a full Super Randonneur series in the qualifying year.</p>
<p>In 2023, <strong>11 Team Asha riders</strong> completed PBP, an extraordinary achievement representing months of dedicated training and thousands of kilometers of qualifying rides.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Randonneuring</h3>
<p>Unlike competitive racing, randonneuring emphasizes <strong>self-sufficiency and camaraderie</strong>. Riders carry their own supplies, navigate independently, and support fellow riders along the way. There are no winners or losers &mdash; only those who finish within the time limit and earn their brevet card.</p>
<p>The rides traverse beautiful countryside routes, often through the night, testing not just physical endurance but mental resilience. Riders must manage nutrition, hydration, sleep deprivation, equipment issues, and weather &mdash; all while maintaining pace.</p>

<h3>Coach Mani &mdash; The OG of Randonneuring</h3>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">Long before the current generation of Team Asha riders took up randonneuring, <strong>Coach Mani</strong> blazed the trail by completing <strong>Paris-Brest-Paris in 2007</strong>. As a pioneering figure in Team Asha's endurance cycling culture, Mani laid the groundwork for everything that followed.</p>

<h3>Team Asha's Randonneuring Journey</h3>
<p>Team Asha's randonneuring group is based in the San Francisco Bay Area, riding events organized by local clubs including <strong><a href="https://sfrandonneurs.org/" target="_blank" style="color:var(--primary);">San Francisco Randonneurs (SFR)</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.davisbikeclub.org/ultracycling" target="_blank" style="color:var(--primary);">Davis Bike Club (DBC)</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.santacruzrandonneurs.org/" target="_blank" style="color:var(--primary);">Santa Cruz Randonneurs (SCR)</a></strong>. Our riders tackle routes through some of California's most beautiful and challenging terrain.</p>
<p>Beyond the physical challenge, our riders raise funds for <strong>Asha for Education</strong>, supporting the education of underprivileged children in India. Every kilometer ridden carries purpose beyond the brevet card.</p>
